# AngleSensor-CircularLEDArray
An AAT angle sensor evaluation kit connected to a NeoPixel LED array via an ATtiny85.

Specifically, we used an AAT003 angle sensor, a NeoPixel 60-LED circular array, and an ATtiny85.
Sensor "SIN" output to PB3; "COS" to PB4; output to NeoPixel Array on PB2.

A calibration routine maximizes accuracy.

The code is compatible with an Arduino Trinket: select "AdaFruit Trinket (ATtiny85 @ 8 MHz)."
